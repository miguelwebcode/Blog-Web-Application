1. **Project Setup:**

   - Create a folder structure for your project. For example:
     ```
     ├── blogWebApp
     │   ├── public
     │   │   ├── styles.css
     │   ├── views
     │   │   ├── home.ejs
     │   │   ├── create.ejs
     │   │   ├── edit.ejs
     │   ├── index.js
     │   ├── package.json
     │   └── README.md
     ```
   - Install necessary dependencies (Node.js, Express.js, EJS).

2. **Routes and Controllers:**

   - Define routes for different pages (home, creation, editing, etc.) in `index.js`.
   - Create controllers to handle the logic behind each route (e.g., create a new post, edit an existing post, etc.).

3. **Views (EJS):**

   - Create EJS templates for different pages (home, creation, editing, etc.).
   - Use EJS to generate dynamic content based on data (e.g., display a list of posts).

4. **Styling and Design:**

   - Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to create an attractive and responsive layout.
   - Design reusable components for headers, forms, buttons, etc.

5. **Key Features:**

   - **Post Creation:**
     - Allow users to write new posts.
     - Guide users through the creation process (title, content).
     - Store posts in memory during the active session.
   - **Post Viewing:**
     - The home page displays a list of all posts created by users.
     - Each post shows essential information like title and creation date.
   - **Editing and Deleting Posts:**
     - Each post has dedicated buttons for editing and deleting.
     - Editing allows modification of the post and saving changes.
     - Deleting removes the post from memory, facilitating content management.

6. **Testing:**

   - Test your application to ensure all functionalities work correctly.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Write a `README.md` explaining how to run and use your application.
